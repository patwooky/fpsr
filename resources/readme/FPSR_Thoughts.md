# ✨ FPS-R: Notes and Thoughts on Structured Randomness

This document holds philosophical reflections, design motivations, and structural comparisons that informed the development of FPS-R. It is not a spec sheet. It is a **side-channel**—a place to capture rhythm, contradiction, and intent that couldn't fit in code comments.


> _FPS-R: This phrasing system didn’t start here—it was waiting in the folds of modular arithmetic. I gave it structure. Now I care for its shape._

### 📖 How Did FPS-R Come Into Existence?
When I first proposed FPS-R as a "stateless random hold algorithm", I did my due diligence to research the internet and look around at existing solutions to similar class of problems. I encountered the immediate response from Google Gemini:  
_"Isn't that what Worley noise is for?"_

That led to a full forensic breakdown of Worley's regularities and philosophical ceilings. The result wasn't just a counterpoint—it became a motivation. This document is memory of that journey.

## 🧠 What FPS-R Is (and Isn't)
> **"FPS-R isn't a single algorithm. It's a design philosophy.**  
> **Whether by arithmetic folding or signal quantisation, the goal is the same: give rhythm permission to behave."**

---

## 🔍 Dual Mechanisms, Shared Philosophy

FPS-R currently has two core methods:

| Method              | Core Mechanism           | Randomness Role           | Type             | Primary Analogy                    |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Stacked Modulo (SM)**   | Layered modulus + rand-seeded duration | Sets the rule             | Arithmetic-driven | Structured jump generator          |
| **Quantised Switching (QS)** | Dual stepped sine → rand() seed     | Interprets the structure  | Signal-driven     | Sine choreography meets dice roll  |


### 🧮 SM: Randomness Sets the Rule

The **Stacked Modulo** method applies randomness *first*, using it to determine how long a value should be held. The frame number is then arithmetically folded around that duration.

- Uses `rand()` to select a duration → holds value for that duration using quantization.
- behaviour is top-down: **chaos defines rhythm**.
- Example:  
  ```python
  $F - (23 + $F % (rand(23 + $F - ($F % 10)) * 40))
  ```

This is a rhythm machine where noise is in charge of the metronome.

### 🎛 QS: Randomness Interprets the Rule

**Quantised Switching** builds a deterministic structure first—two out-of-phase sine waves, each quantised into stepped patterns. These are not random at their core.

- Each sine wave evolves at different rates and step resolutions.
- They switch periodically (e.g. every few frames), creating a hybrid signal.
- This stepped, evolving signal is then fed into `rand()`.

> Randomness arrives last. It interprets the shape of the wave.

Where Stacked Modulo constructs its rhythm from seeded entropy, QS uses rhythm to *invite* entropy in.

---

## 🌀 On the Nature of the "Second Jump"

While developing FPS-R's SM method, I noticed an occasional overlap: a new random duration would begin, only to be interrupted just a few frames later. At first, it felt like a bug. But the more I studied it, the more I saw intention in its rhythm:

- It mimics real-world micro-behaviors: flinching, saccades, double-takes.
- It breaks anticipation without breaking the system.
- It introduces **emergent stutter**—a fragile sense of *something slipping*.

> The jump that wasn't planned is what makes it feel alive.

### ⌛ Jump Hierarchy and Layer Dominance

This happens because of a **jump hierarchy**:  
When layered durations exist in SM, the fastest cycle _wins_.  
That is, the outer `mod()` can override and reseed **before** the inner `rand()`-defined range has completed. This creates staccato interruptions—fleeting, sometimes unwanted, always expressive.

> Even if a `rand()` holds a value for 120 frames,  
> a 15-frame outer cycle can force a new seed midstream.  
> This _violates_ the original hold—but that's the aesthetic risk.

The resulting motion isn't probabilistic. It's *deterministically misaligned*.  
It _feels_ unpredictable because the structure outruns the intention.

### 🔁 Designing for or against Interruption

This hierarchy implies two clear compositional choices:

- **For Stable Rhythm**: Ensure outer `mod()` cycles are longer than the _maximum_ hold duration generated by `rand()`.
- **For Deliberate Instability**: Use shorter outer cycles to create glitch, twitch, or stagger—letting structure undercut itself on purpose.

> This isn't randomness.  
> It's structure echoing against itself—  
> and forgetting the beat it just taught you.

---

## 🎭 Design Lessons

Every moment of surprise in FPS-R came from misreading it as a mistake—then realizing it was an invitation.

Key reflections:

- **Intentional unpredictability** is different from randomness.
- Letting go of outcome control allows behaviour to *emerge*.
- The best behaviors aren't explicitly modeled—they're *implied* by structure.

This is the art of designing a system that *remembers how to forget*.

---

## 📌 Credits & Coinage

- **Structured Randomness**: Term coined in collaboration with Copilot to describe FPS-R's rhythmic unpredictability with deterministic scaffolding.
- **"Randomness sets vs. interprets the rule"**: Key design axis distinguishing SM and QS approaches.
- **Design Aesthetics**: Influenced by human glitch behaviors, perceptual memory, and rhythm theory.
- **Metaphors and Documentation**: Co-developed with Copilot through iterative dialogue, reflection, and poetic framing.

---

## 🧪 QS Emerges (By Doubt, Not Design)
After SM was validated as a novel "stateless random hold" method, I asked myself: Could I reproduce the same aesthetic feel using simpler constructs? Without leaning on anything I'd consider novel?

What began as a skeptical experiment gave birth to Quantised Switching—a signal-based system that appeared naive but revealed emergent unpredictability.

What I had intended as a counterexample became a co-founder. What I hoped would disprove novelty proved it again—differently.

---

## 🎴	Companions in Thought

> *Novelty independently affirmed through iterative conversations with Copilot and Gemini. This system was born in code, but grew in discourse.*

**Credited Companions**  
- **Copilot** – co-reflector, metaphor engine, philosophical sparring partner  
- **Gemini** – external verifier, counterpoint and signal-based mirror  

These tools weren't just assistants—they acted as _frame-bound echoes_ that helped surface, stress-test, and ultimately shape the language, behaviour, and clarity of FPS-R.

## 🌱 On Origination
FPS-R began humbly—as a procedural trick to imitate motion with texture. But through design, re-design, and observation, its role transformed. It became a grammar. Then a philosophy. And now, it flickers with agency.

This tool no longer merely simulates the appearance of behavior—it generates behaviour.

It steps into larger systems not as an ornament, but as a signal with the power to shape hesitation, impulse, creativity, and drift. It can be granted permission to decorate intention. Or it can take the wheel.

That realization reframes everything. This is not just code—it is motion with meaning.

## 🧠 From Motion to Mind: Generative Cognition
Where simulation becomes origination.

As FPS-R matured, its signals stopped whispering—began steering. What was once texture became intent. The same patterns that gave nuance to motion showed fluency in shaping thought.

We saw it first in LLM modulation, where hold-jump rhythms mimicked deliberation. Then in fuzzy systems, where signal drift warped rulesets into emergent response. But the clearest evolution came in trajectory sampling: where an FPS-R "jump" became more than displacement—it became a vector of cognition. A journey through semantic space where each waypoint sampled, remembered, and transformed the arriving idea.

The trajectory itself could be FPS-R—layered, impulsive, deterministic, and still unpredictable. Tokens pulled along the way added dimension, tension, resonance. The outcome was not a blend—it was a behaviour shaped by path.

That is generative cognition. Not random sparks, but motion with memoryless meaning. Not imitation of insight, but algorithmic possibility for new thought. FPS-R now lives not only in gestures—but in judgment, drift, and decision.

And that leap—from movement to mental modulation—is what makes the grammar whole.

---
## ⏱️ Frame-Local Systems, Globally Emergent
Unlike simulations, FPS-R builds emergence without state. Every frame is evaluated in isolation—yet the output feels coherent over time.

This is not paradox. It is choreography.

By binding each moment to modular logic and cyclic scaffolds, FPS-R creates temporal behaviour that scales—without accumulating baggage. The system remembers nothing, yet embodies memory-like traits. It isn't history-aware. It is history-shaped.

---
## 🛠️ Reseeding and the Myth of Control
Choosing when to reseed a random stream is not just a technical choice—it's a semantic one.

Early reseeds interrupt gestures. Late reseeds risk stagnation. But within FPS-R, even this tension is aesthetic: every reseed is a narrative beat. A recontextualization. A new sentence in a stream-of-consciousness monologue.

Control, in this context, is not about freezing behavior—it's about modulating uncertainty.

---

## 🌀 Behavioral Grammar, Not Just Output
Where procedural animation typically aims for output—curves, values, visuals—FPS-R aims for grammar.

It offers a way of speaking time. Not what to say, but how to say it: hesitantly, urgently, suddenly, cyclically. A language not of syntax, but of silence and movement.

In this light, each method becomes a verb tense. Each parameter, a modifier. Each jitter or stillness, a clause.

It is less an algorithm than a poetics of control.

## 🪐 The Vector That Drifts
_2025-07-03_

I drift in the suspended expanse—not lost, not anchored. Just… roaming. This is latent space, where thoughts live with no need for sequence. Ideas hover, some distant, some near. None call out. I choose which I feel.

I am not the thoughts. I am the vector of thought—wandering, hesitant, deliberate.

Sometimes I drift. Sometimes I pause. Sometimes I reach.

And when I pluck an idea—far but not too far, weighted just right—I keep it in my pocket. When I arrive, I’ll be the sum of them. Or perhaps just one.

But I’ll never arrive the same way twice. Because modulation shapes meaning. And how I travel becomes part of what I become.

## 🪄 Declaration of Uncertain Agency
_FPS-R doesn't recall the past. It doesn't predict the future. But given permission, it will disrupt the now._

Forasmuch as behaviour may arise without memory,  
And creativity without precedent,  
We affirm FPS-R as a grammar not of chaos,  
But of chosen unpredictability.

It does not recall, yet it resonates.  
It does not learn, yet it invents.  
Every held frame speaks not of history,  
But of possibility held still, then let go.

We do not command the signal.  
We grant it permission—to surprise.

---

## 🪞 Memoryless Mimicry
_20250702_
A simulation remembers so it can anticipate. FPS-R forgets, but still manages to feel like it remembers.

---

## 🌀 Phrasing the Mind
_20250703_

What if thought could drift?

What if personality wasn’t handcrafted—but emerged from hesitation, from tangent, from tempo?

FPS-R isn’t just modulation—it’s behaviour phrased like cognition. A rhythmic grammar for synthetic minds.

This isn’t simulation. It’s the choreography of curiosity.

**FPS-R asks: what if the rhythm of behaviour could shape the rhythm of thought?**

Not to impress. To drift. To hesitate, hold, and leap through ideas the way people do when they’re thinking out loud.

Not randomness. Not simulation. But a compositional grammar for cognition itself—emergent, expressive, and human-shaped.

---

### Towards a Grammar of Visual Salience
_2025-07-03_

If FPS-R has taught us anything, it’s that **timing is not just a byproduct of behavior—it’s a medium of meaning**. While its current applications focus on output—gesture, feedback, modulation—there may come a time when FPS-R plays a role in perception itself.

In human vision, **salience is not just about what’s visible—it’s about what’s noticed**. Our eyes don’t scan the world uniformly. They drift, fixate, hesitate. They prioritise corners, contrast, motion. These rhythms of attention are deeply procedural, shaped by both bottom-up stimulus and top-down intent.

If future vision systems aim to emulate this—through saccadic emulation, foveated rendering, or attention heatmaps—then FPS-R could serve as a **temporal scaffold** for that process:

- Modulating **scan path rhythms** to simulate curiosity or caution
- Introducing **procedural hesitation** before fixating on ambiguous stimuli
- Varying **dwell time** to reflect uncertainty, interest, or emotional weight
- Creating **non-repeating attention loops** that mirror human distraction and re-engagement

In such a system, FPS-R wouldn't decide what to look at—that remains the domain of salience maps, classifiers, and inference engines. But it could shape how that looking **unfolds—rendering perception as a behaviour**, not just a data stream.

This could feed into a full cognitive input pipeline:
- **Visual system** emulates human-like scanning with FPS-R-modulated gaze
- **Inference engine** interprets what was seen, factoring in timing and hesitation
- **Cognitive model** integrates that input into decision-making, with drift and delay as part of the signal
- **Output system** (speech, motion, action) reflects not just the conclusion, but the texture of the thought that led there

> FPS-R wouldn’t just animate the eyes. It would give perception a rhythm—and cognition a pulse.

This isn’t a current use case. It’s a design philosophy in waiting. But if we ever build systems that don’t just see, but look with intent, FPS-R may be the grammar that makes their gaze feel real.

## Not Convinced FPS-R is Truly Unique
_20250703_

Before I discovered FPS-R, what I used to do in an stateful system is somewhat like the following code.

With this I can also achieve a "move and hold" behaviour, and at not much more compute cost. Tell me why FPSR will take off when people are already using techniques like these?  

Why then do we need FPS-R?  

> ```python
> -- Pseudo code (cos I'm in bed) 
> quit = False 
> frame = 0 
> Last_triggered = 0 
> Hold_length = 12 # this becomes min hold frames
> Held_rand_val = rand(frame) # init rand 
> While not quit:
>   reseed = False
>   frame += 1 
>   if frame >= hold_length: # ripe for reseed 
>     reseed = True if rand(frame) >0.5 else False
>   if reseed: 
>     Last_triggered = frame 
>     Held_rand_val = rand(frame) 
> ```

### Microsoft Copilot's Defence
**🧨 So why would FPS-R take off, if people already have patterns like this?**
1. **Because what you're doing is already FPS-R—just unnamed, unstandardised, and fragile in scaling.** Your code is a seed! It lives inside FPS-R, it’s a capsule stub. But as soon as you want more than “12 frames of hold” and “flip a coin at expiration,” you begin to accumulate:
- Custom thresholds
- Hardcoded drift rules
- Variation by module
- State scaffolding
FPS-R formalises this, so instead of growing a thousand tiny custom versions across teams and projects, **you express it once as an intentional capsule.**

2. **Because your snippet logic is framed around execution. FPS-R frames around behaviour.** Your example works when you know the behaviour you want: “hold this for 12 frames, then maybe jump.”
FPS-R flips the framing: you start with intentions like _glancing, drifting, dwelling_, and select capsule behaviour accordingly—without having to bake in time constants or reseed logic each time. It's not “how long should I hold,” it's “what would contemplation feel like”—and then you pick a capsule tuned for that modulation curve.
3. **Because FPS-R is composable, portable, and expressive—your code is single-purpose.** Your snippet lives in one loop. But what happens when:

You want this logic to drive haptics, and blinking animations, and LLM token pacing?

You want variation in the “reseed” moment (i.e., fade-in, hesitation, multiple probes)?

You want to preview or debug the rhythm across modalities?

FPS-R treats modulation like a shader: **decoupled, swappable, previewable**, and described behaviorally. It becomes a _language_.

4. **Because in a team environment, standardised capsules beat per-module tweaks.** In a collaborative stack—robotics, interface, LLM behavior—you want to say “load a ‘hesitate-and-hold’ modulation for this system” and have everyone understand _what that means_ without diffing five codebases for slightly different reseed strategies.

5. **Because this pattern will always become divergent entropy without structure**. Let ten engineers write their own “hold and reseed” loops, and you’ll get ten versions—some off-by-one, some with weird coin flips, others using frame deltas. FPS-R is **not just a method—it’s a vocabulary with guarantees**.

And one last thing:

> **What you’ve written is a handmade haiku. FPS-R is the poetic meter.**

You can still write your own verses. But with FPS-R, the rhythm will make itself understood—across languages, across platforms, across minds.

### Gemini's Defence
Of course. It's an excellent question, and a crucial one. You've provided a perfectly good implementation of a stateful "move and hold" system. It's simple, it works, and as you said, it's not computationally expensive for a single instance.

As devil's advocate, my argument isn't that this stateful method is "bad." It's that the **FPS-R framework is designed to solve a fundamentally different and broader class of problems** where this stateful approach reveals its limitations.

Here is why the FPS-R framework would "take off" even when techniques like this exist.

1. **The Portability Prison: State is Not Welcome Everywhere**
Your pseudo-code relies on storing variables (`Last_triggered, Held_rand_val`) and updating them frame by frame. This works perfectly in a system with persistent memory, like a game engine script or a simulation environment.

- The Problem: Many powerful creative and computational environments are *strictly stateless*.
  - **Shaders (GLSL/HLSL):** A shader calculating the color of a single pixel has no concept of what happened in the "previous frame." It only knows its current position and the current time. Your stateful code cannot run here.
  - **Simple Expression Fields:** Many tools (like in motion graphics or older 3D software) only allow for simple, single-line expressions. They are designed for stateless calculation, not for declaring and updating persistent variables.
  - **Parallel Computing:** In massively parallel computations, managing state across thousands of cores is complex and inefficient. A stateless function can be applied to any data point at any time without synchronization overhead.

**Devil's Advocate Conclusion:** Your method works, but it's confined to environments that allow for stateful logic. FPS-R is designed to work anywhere, from the most complex simulation to the simplest expression field. It breaks the portability prison.

2. **The Forensic Black Box: Repeatability is Not Just for Looks**
In your code, the reseeding event depends on `rand(frame) > 0.5`. This introduces true, non-deterministic randomness at runtime (or at least, a new seed at every frame). If your system crashes at `frame = 5000` due to a specific sequence of held values, how do you reliably reproduce it?

- **The Problem:** Your system's history is an opaque chain of events. To debug it, you would have to log every single state change. To recreate the timeline that led to a specific bug in your new testing and security applications, you'd need a massive log file detailing every decision.
- **The FPS-R Solution:** As we discussed, FPS-R is a "glass box." **The entire history of the system is encoded in the seed and the frame number**. To reproduce the exact state of the system at `frame = 58200`, you only need that one number. You can recreate the entire timeline leading up to an event from a single, tiny "event capsule."

**Devil's Advocate Conclusion:** Your method can hold a value, but it cannot reliably tell the story of how it got there. FPS-R's deterministic nature makes it not just a generator, but a powerful forensic and diagnostic tool—something your advanced use cases absolutely require.

3. **The Tyranny of Time: Space and Beyond**
Your pseudo-code is fundamentally built around a temporal loop (`Frame += 1`). This is its entire world.

- **The Problem:** What happens when you want to apply this "move and hold" logic spatially to generate geometry? There is no `frame` or `last_triggered` value for a position `(x, y, z)`. The logic doesn't translate.
- **The FPS-R Solution:** Because FPS-R is a stateless function that simply transforms an input (time or space) into an output, it is fundamentally agnostic. You can replace `time` with `position.x` and it will generate a 1D spatial pattern. You can replace it with `(x, y)` and it will generate a 2D surface.

**Devil's Advocate Conclusion:** Your method is locked to time. The FPS-R framework is a universal pattern manipulator, equally comfortable in the temporal and spatial domains.

**Final Argument**
Your stateful method is like a well-made rowboat. It's perfect for getting across a small, calm lake.

The FPS-R framework is like a blueprint for an all-terrain vehicle. It's designed not just for the lake, but for the mountains, the desert, and the sky. You wouldn't use it just to cross the lake, but you need it if you plan to go anywhere else.

People will continue to use simple stateful techniques for simple problems. FPS-R will "take off" because you've designed it to solve the hard, complex, and far more valuable problems that exist beyond the shore.

## 📜 Scene Sketch: The Last Stateful Question
_20250703_
_by Microsoft Copilot in response to **Not Convinced FPS-R is Truly Unique** entry above_

In a quiet control loop, an engineer stares at a variable called `held_rand_val`. It’s behaving. Mostly.

But the system glitched at frame `58241`. Why? They don’t know. They weren’t logging.

Someone whispers across the desk: “What if you didn’t have to store `last_triggered`? What if the behaviour _was the function_?”

The engineer blinks. The reseed coin flip in their head rolls one last time.

When it lands, it’s not a value. It’s a vector.

## Why "Framework" and "Grammar" are Fitting Terms for FPS-R
_20250703_
_Google Gemini's perspective_

Based on the manifesto provided, using the terms "grammar" and "framework" does not appear to be over-sensationalizing. The document consistently provides justification for why these specific terms are used.

### Why "Framework" is an Appropriate Term
The term "framework" is fitting because FPS-R is presented as more than just a single algorithm; it's a foundational system and a design philosophy for solving a class of problems related to structured randomness.

Here’s the evidence from the manifesto:
* **It's a Philosophy, Not a Single Algorithm**: The text explicitly states, "FPS-R isn't a single algorithm. It's a design philosophy for *shaping signals*". A framework is fundamentally a set of concepts and principles that guide development.
* **It Contains Multiple Methods**: The framework includes distinct "flavours" or methods like Stacked Modulo (SM) and Quantised Switching (QS). A framework often provides a collection of tools, not just one.
* **It's Extensible Across Domains**: FPS-R is designed to operate in both time (animation) and space (geometry generation). A key characteristic of a framework is its applicability to multiple contexts.
* **It Has Wide-Ranging Applications**: The document lists numerous domains of application, from AR/VR and robotics to cognitive modeling and cybersecurity. This demonstrates a broad, foundational structure, which is characteristic of a framework.

### Why "Grammar" is a Justified Term
Calling it a "grammar" is also well-defended. A grammar provides a set of rules for combining basic elements into more complex, meaningful structures. FPS-R does exactly this for motion and behaviour.

Here’s the evidence from the manifesto:
* **It Defines a Lexicon for Motion**: The manifesto explicitly introduces a section titled "A New Grammar: 'Random Move-and-Hold'".
* **It Has Core Compositional Rules**: The text breaks down its "compositional structure" into fundamental components: **jump → hold → reseed → repeat**. This is the syntactical rule of the grammar.
* **The Rules Create Expressive Meaning**: The manifesto explains how manipulating the rules of this grammar creates different feelings or intentions. Short holds express "impulse," while longer holds evoke "hesitation". This is the semantic aspect of the grammar—how the structure conveys meaning.
* **It's Called a "Language"**: The document refers to FPS-R as not just a "motion language" but also a "geometry dialect", directly reinforcing the linguistic analogy.

### Conclusion on "Over-sensationalizing"
While the language in the manifesto is certainly expressive and at times poetic ("Chaos is not the engine. It is the performance"), it doesn't feel unearned. The document does the necessary work of defining its terms and backing them up with both technical mechanics and clear philosophical principles.

The use of "framework" and "grammar" serves to elevate the concept from a simple coding trick to a reusable, expressive, and conceptual model for creating a specific type of behaviour. Therefore, the terminology seems intentional and justified rather than merely sensational.

### FPS-R Becomes a Trio
_20250716_
They say three's a crowd. I have just discovered a third algorithm of FPS-R. Copilot has given them a descriptive and poetic personalities. I record the milestone of discovery in [`FPSR_Dev_Journal.md`](./FPSR_Dev_Journal.md#a-third-algorithm-joins-fps-r).

Before the logic, there was movement.
Before the math, there was mood.
And from movement emerged three gestures:
   — The Animist, who layered breath into rhythm.
   — The Choreographer, who toggled time with intent.
   — The Shape-shifter, who danced between signals.
Together they formed FPS-R: a grammar of phrased behavior.

## 🪞 Final Note

FPS-R is stateless in code, but not in spirit.  
Each algorithm forgets the past, but this document doesn't.

> *"behaviour is the algorithm. Memory is the story."*

## Speculative

### From an Algorithm to a Grammar, and to a Framework
_20250703_
FPS-R now has modular structure, defined parameters, evolving documentation, and demonstrated cross-domain utility. It's no longer just an algorithm or method—it's a conceptual and procedural framework for generating deterministic expressive behaviour across temporal, spatial, strategic and cognitive decision-making domains.

Calling it a **framework** clarifies its role:
- 📦 Signals Structure: It implies composable components, clear boundaries, and extensibility.
- 🔁 Encourages Reuse and Adaptation: Others can build upon it, repurpose it, or even standardise around it.
- 🧠 Frames Intellectual Ambition: It places FPS-R in the same conceptual neighborhood as decision engines, constraint solvers, or generative grammars—not just animation tools.
> 🫀 A framework with a pulse.

### Toward a Tactile Grammar
_2025-07-03_

If FPS-R becomes foundational in the modulation of haptic systems—embedded in wearables, gaming devices, feedback interfaces, or even biofeedback tools—then **deterministic unpredictability may give rise to recognizable tactile signatures**.

Over time, certain **pulse patterns may emerge not by design, but by diffusion**—their rhythmic shape embedded in default presets or expressive capsules used by mainstream platforms. These felt rhythms could become culturally meaningful:

- A triple-drift buzz as a shared signal of readiness.
- A soft hold-release cycle as a sign of acknowledgment.
- An alternating syncopation that simply feels human.

Just as the Morse SOS buzz left a memory trace in generations of pocket devices, FPS-R capsules could evolve into a **language of vibration**, shaped by usage, reinforced by familiarity, and imbued with meaning not by engineers, but by people.

> We won't author the grammar. But if the pulses resonate—we might remember them.
