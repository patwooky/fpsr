## ‚úçÔ∏è FPS-R Capsule Contribution Guide
Creating and Sharing Behavioral Phrases in FPS-R

## üéØ What Is a FPS-R Capsule?
A **FPS-R capsule** is a mechanism that **stores** and **captures** FPS-R's performances of structured and deterministic unpredictability. 

A FPS-R capsule's settings is **reusable**, and a capsule's performance is **repeatable**. These settings and performances shows how FPS-R's behaviour unfolds over time using only a seed, input signal, and configuration‚Äîwithout memory. Capsules can either be:

### Storage
**Reusable parameter settings:** to replicate the state of FPS-R at the point of capture.

### Capture
**Captured Performances:** curated windows of time that showcase distinctive phrasing

Here is the format of a capsule file.

## üå± Naming Guidelines (Optional, Suggested)
Capsules represent captured performances‚Äîthey‚Äôre behavioral phrases, not just functions. Name them like gestures, not parameters.
- Use flowing phrase structures, like [adjective] verb ‚Äì [adjective] verb ‚Äì [optional more phrases]  
Examples:
    - calm hold ‚Äì huge jump
    - glitch ‚Äì stutter3x ‚Äì hold ‚Äì final calm
    - tight pulse ‚Äì slip ‚Äì vanish
- Speak to the **feel**, not the implementation. Avoid overly technical terms‚Äîfavour motion, energy, rhythm.
- Compound phrases are welcome. Don‚Äôt limit length unless for UI constraints. Let clarity and cadence guide you.
- Optional: use timing hints like `stutter3x`, `long hold`, or mood tags like `soft`, `erratic`, `final`.
- Group by behavioral tags: "`glitch`", "`sustain`", "`hesitation`", "`burst`", "`spiral`"‚Äînot tech specs like `mod_inner_dur`.
- Think like a movement director, not a math parser. What would you call this if it were a dance or a gesture in dialogue?

## üß™ How to Observe & Curate a Capsule
1. **Start from a preset ‚Äì** define core parameters, mod durations, and seed
2. **Run it through your FPS-R system ‚Äì** play over timeline or field
3. **Watch for phrasing ‚Äì** does a recognizable behaviour emerge over N frames?
4. **If so, record:**
- Start frame = beginning of phrased gesture
- End frame = last frame where phrasing holds
- Optional: annotate or preview export
5. **Name it** based on its contour (e.g., linger-jump, wobble-fade)
6. **Wrap into** `.capsule.json` as a documented behaviour

## üå± The Spirit of Sharing
FPS-R capsules are meant to be shared‚Äînot just as assets, but as expressive fragments of understanding. Each one captures a phrasing, a modulation, a moment that felt intentional. Sharing them openly means building a collective language of behaviour, where anyone can contribute, remix, or reuse phrasing as a creative gesture.

This isn‚Äôt just data. It‚Äôs a living vocabulary. With it we can form complete sentences, and passages with these performance "clips".

The goal isn‚Äôt control‚Äîit‚Äôs resonance. As the library grows, so does our collective ability to describe movement, signal intent, and craft synthetic motion with clarity and emotion. Capsules are our shared phrases. The more we share, the more fluent we become.

### üå± The Current State of the Capsules Technology
The implementation of FPS-R Capsules is **still in the conception stage**. The vision is clear and the use-cases for FPS-R Capsules are vast.

As the technology matures and its use becomes wide-spread, the need of capturing performances and sharing them will become increasingly helpful and important. 

As the framework takes off, more work will be put into refining and implementing the capsule technology.

## ü§ù Attribution & Community
FPS-R is an open framework for expressive modulation. If you‚Äôve used its capsule data or principles in your own creative work, a small attribution‚Äîlinking back to this repository‚Äîis deeply appreciated.

More importantly: if you‚Äôve created your own phrasing, named a new behaviors, or refined a modulation idea‚Äîwe invite you to contribute it back to the growing capsule library.

This project thrives not just on usage, but on conversation. Let‚Äôs teach the world to speak in phrasing.
